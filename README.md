# CGS-ROBOT
This idea initially started in the SAP Semicolon Hackathon in the year 2019-2020. We designed a model that could help to clean the oil spill in the ocean. We used a simple controlling code in this repository to control the bot with mobile phone with the help of bluetooth.

# DESIGNS WE USED
Model Design 1 - Floating test of this model was a failure

Model Design 2- This design also failed terribly in water

Model Design 3 - We came up with this another design that passed the floating test. This model actually passed out various floating test and was able to balance the weight that it is supposed to hold. This weight included the weight of the components, sorbent and the oil itself.

# COMPONENTS
We included components from a simple bluetooth controlled car to simulate the same in water.
1. AURDINO UNO
2. BLUETOOTH MODULE
3. MOTOR DRIVER
4. MOTOR
5. RECHARGEABLE BATTERY

# IDEA DISCONTINUED
We stopped working for this problem in this way. The people worked in this including me are CSE and IT Engineering Students. We moved away from solving this problem to focus on skills that our department needed at that time.
